1. Add rpcconnector to have realtime status updates for online/offline and other services - done with SSE
2. allow broadcasting, so if there are more than one service with the same capability
the run the job and the first one to respond wins
3. when a service is processing change from online to busy, when it is no longer busy put back to online - done
4. when a grpc_hub_connector gets a service make sure grpc_hub gives a service that it is not busy, if
all of the services are busy then give a random service that match the name requested. - done
5. If all the services are busy then create a stack of calls to the service and wait until the service is back online.
